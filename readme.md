# Voter Registrationator 3000

This app aims to make registering to vote easy. Using the Rock the Vote API, it creates a valid registration PDF. It then lets you add the required photo IDs and then fax the form and ID to the appropriate municipal clerk. 

Based on the [Stencil Starter](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-app-starter).
